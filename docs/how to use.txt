This project is based on Expo React native

There will be some Pro tip in the project... You can read them but if you don't understand it is fine... 
Pro tip are not necessary for starting coding and make your app working, it will just make you code better
You can try to understand them a few months (or year) later..

# ES6 reminders

React native is based on javascript
I use a lot of javascript es6 operators (latest javascript syntax) in this project to write complex code with just a few lines

You need to know:

map array operator -->  transform an array to another array

ternary operator --- eg: bool ? valA : valB  equivalent to if(bool) {valA} else {valB}

&& operator --- eg: a && b   equivalent to if(a) {do b}

spread operator -->  {...obj}  equivalent to everything inside obj

# React
React native is based on React
It is helps to know React web before learning React Native

Core concept of React 
Functionnal component vs Class component
Class component is the old preferred way to code react, you need to learn it if you want to work on old project
Functionnal component is the new preferred way to code react, you need to learn it if you want to work on new project
Why functionnal component is preferred over class component??
Because it is there is easier to understand functionnal component if you wrote the correctly!
Core concept of functionnal programming "1 FUNCTION 1 PURPOSE" so "1 COMPONENT 1 PURPOSE"
In that way each function is independant to each others, no side effects or a few so easier to test also

# Virtual DOM
Ideally, you need to understand how react render you app... 
Actually react rebuild constantly your app (whenever your state change or an event you are listenning like click or typping happened)... 
But it is done fast thanks to the Virtual DOM...
If your understand the Virtual DOM, you understand that all your component are keep re-creating themself and all previous value are lost except the state of your component you saved
PRO TIP: check memoization concept


# React native vs React
Mobile react native developement is like react web developement but with limited options compare to web
In web, you use html/css but in react native you use native component and stylesheet which are similar to html/css syntax but are more limited
For example: in React native there is only 2 main tags "View" for container which are flexblox and "Text" which are inline for your text
In React native there is less styles rules, no hover, no after, only flexbox, no aria, etc...

# Expo vs Bare React Native
Expo is built on top of React Native to make things easier (it is easier to add dependencies and deployment for example)
But expo is more limited than Bare React Native so not used in big project

# How to understand this project
App.js is the index file of this project it return the customer bottom tab navigator
All navigators of the app is inside the navigators folders
A navigator is used to define the route of your app

Common UI components are inside components folder

Your assets are inside assets folder


Each screens of your app has one folder inside the screens folder
Some big screen folder has their own component folder


Try to understand easy screen and the components folder first
